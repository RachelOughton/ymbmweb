    I currently have a focus on formative assessment in higher mathematics, and in particular on the role computer-aided assessment can play in this.
    
    Aside from mathematics, I’m interested in computing and technology, gaming and climbing.

    My research in statistics focusses on adapting methodology to model complex situations. I am (or have been) involved in projects about educational interventions, criminology, petroleum geoscience, flood modelling and health care provision. 
  
    I'm also involved in maths outreach and enjoy talking about maths with people who might not so often hear about it. Young Minds Big Maths is a big part of this! 

    In my spare time, I enjoy sewing, knitting and reading, and spending time with my family.

    I have enjoyed being able to make my little contributions to this website. I hope that anyone who is interested in YMBM enjoys what has been written by myself and others.
    
    However, whilst I do have a passion for mathematics, it is not the only thing that I like to revolve myself around. Since I was eight, I have been playing the piano. It’s been classical music mainly but after, hopefully, achieving my Grade 8 in 2024, I would like to branch out into other genres. I could only dream of being at Elton John’s level but that’s always something to strive for!
    
    Along with this, I really love reading at whatever chance I can get and, perhaps to many mathematicians’ horrors, I’m an English Literature lover at heart. Hopefully, I would like to one day be able to say that I’ve read my fair share of gothic novels, such as The Vampyre and The Picture of Dorian Grey.
    
    Thank you to anyone who has taken time to read about me and I hope that you also enjoy exploring the different parts of this website!

    As a recent MMath graduate from Durham University I am currently sharing my love of maths through participation in the YMBM project. 
    
    Outside of maths I enjoy ballroom dancing, crochet and sudokus.
