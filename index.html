<p>This page is for anyone who works with young children and who would like to explore maths through familiar objects and ideas. Some articles are very specific to a particular activity (for example <a href="/articles/count1">'counting milk'</a>) or connection (like <a href="/articles/triangles_in_construction">'triangles in construction'</a>), and others are there to give some more general maths background (such as <a href="/articles/symmetry">'symmetry'</a> or <a href="/articles/angles">'angles'</a>).</p> 

<p>The real-life examples are mostly taken from early years settings, but the maths may sometimes go beyond what most 3 or 4 year olds would be ready for. We hope this might still be useful for the interested reader, or for someone working with older children.</p>

<p>If you want to browse, you could have a look at these most recent articles. If you would like to find maths ideas relating to something specific, then the topic filter under <a href="/articles">'all articles'</a> might be more helpful.</p>

<p>We hope you find this website useful! If you have any feedback, please feel free to email r.h.oughton [at] durham.ac.uk.
We'd also love to see these ideas being used in practice - if you're able to share, please use the hashtag #YMBMwebsite.</p>
