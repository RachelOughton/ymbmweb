<p>This page is for anyone who works with young children and who would like to explore maths through familiar objects and ideas. The examples are from early years settings, but some of the maths goes beyond what most 3 or 4 year olds are ready for. In our meetings (see <a href="/about/">'About YMBM'</a> ) the mathematicians and early years educators talk about whatever maths links to the children's interests. The educators use their knowledge of the children, and their expertise in early years education, to decide what to explore with the children, and when and how. These articles are written with the same aim in mind.</p>

<p>Some articles are very specific to a particular activity (for example <a href="/articles/count1">'counting milk'</a>) or connection (like <a href="/articles/triangles_in_construction">'triangles in construction'</a>), and others are there to give some more general maths background (such as <a href="/articles/symmetry">'symmetry'</a> or <a href="/articles/angles">'angles'</a>). The topic filter at <a href="/articles">'all articles'</a> should help you find articles linked to your children's interests.</p> 

<p>This website is a work in progress and we'd love to know what's working and how we can improve it. If you have any feedback, <a href = "https://forms.office.com/e/NXkg3wW44S" target="_blank"> please use this form </a>.
We'd also love to see these ideas being used in practice - if you're able to share, please use the hashtag #YMBMwebsite.</p>
