One of the games that the children can play is stacking a set of cogs on top of one another. These cogs are different shapes, colours and sizes which means that you could do this in a sequence (pattern) or the children could simply stack them however they wanted.

This child decided to stack the cogs from biggest to smallest, although she might not describe it as a mathematical idea, she is thinking in a sequence.

During this activity, they struggled to put the cogs in the correct order due to the fact that some of the teeth were different shapes. From a mathematical point of view, this is understandable as the teeth on one cog may be different in size to the teeth on the other, meaning that their areas look similar when viewed but are actually different under closer inspection. This is something that you would not expect a nursery pupil to see straight away.

These cogs were rearranged to be put in their true size order. There are similarities between this activity and the puzzle called the "Tower of Hanoi".

This game would arguably be something that this child and other children could be taught when they are further on in their education as it is similar to that of the stacking game that this child had enjoyed.
