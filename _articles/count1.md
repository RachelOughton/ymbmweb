One of the children enjoyed counting the amount of milk cartons needed for the group. This activity was understandably difficult for this child as they had to count the number of milk cartons and then the number of children, and the children were moving. This way of thinking is arguably quite systematic and natural.

After they were encouraged to stand closer to the other children in order to count them, they were able to understand how many milk cartons were needed for the children.

Once they had arrived at the fridge, the teacher helped them to count on their fingers how many more cartons of milk were needed. This is a mathematical method commonly used in primary schools and nurseries, however at the time, this child struggled to understand how many more cartons were needed by counting on her fingers.

Because they struggled with this method, an alternative method was used in which, after recalling the number of children in the nursery, they counted on from the amount of milk that they already had and stopped at the number of children in the nursery. This alternative method was thought of as "we have milk cartons 1 to 7 for children 1 to 7, however, we need milk number 8 for child number 8, milk number 9 for child number 9 and milk number 10 for child number 10". This is arguably more natural, and easier to understand than simply counting on your fingers and saying "we need extra milk 1, extra milk 2 and extra milk 3".

Later, addition and subtraction was briefly looked at, seeing how 7+3=10, 10-7=3 and 10-3=7 are all, basically, talking about the same situation. This is known by the older children as a "fact family".
