One day at a participating nursery, some of the children were finger-painting pictures of worms. Whilst this activity is simple and fun, there is an underlying part of mathematics that links with repeating patterns and transformations. For example, this child was painting one of their pictures with lines that went red, blue, blue, red, blue, blue...etc. Thus, the repeating pattern of red, blue, blue is a sequence. There are many repititons like this all around, like in music, songs and poetry.

A repeating pattern can be described in two ways. One way is to find a chunk of the pattern from which you could make the whole pattern (we call this the *unit of repeat*). In the example above, the unit of repeat is **red blue blue**. You could demonstrate this by for example printing using a cut potato with the unit of repeat on, and creating the pattern from that single block. The other way of describing this is by looking at the whole pattern (mathematicians would generally treat the sequence as though it continues repeating forever) and then see if it would be possible to slide this repeating pattern so that it "fits" exactly on top of itself. This could be demonstrated by using transparent plastic, tracing paper or by using a light-table.

To describe this to this child, you could slide the snake along itself, even though the dots may not be the same size due to finger-painting the same idea can be conveyed nonetheless. This snake has a one-dimensional pattern.
