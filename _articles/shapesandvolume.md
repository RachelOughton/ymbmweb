As one group activity, some of the children spent their time making lots of different sized balls out of dough. This then allowed them to spend the time exploring the idea of increasing and decreasing sizes, by placing them into order and having conversations about how to increase or decrease the sizes/masses of the balls. From here, the children were able to develop their mathematical thinking skills by experimenting with putting the different sizes together or taking some small pieces of the ball away and seeing how this affects its size or mass, deepening their previous knowledge on addition and subtraction.  This can also link with the idea that the mass of two balls added together will be equal to the mass of the one ball when those two balls are combined. Although this may be something that seems almost obvious to many people, it is often quite difficult for young children to understand and so, offering a more visual representation of this will make it a lot easier for them to get their heads around.

As well as this, the children were able to explore the effects of halving the dough or doubling the amount of dough, which fits very well when it comes to simple mathematical skills needed when it comes to much more complex equations or models. Therefore, this gives the children the time to understand the ideas completely that they start to explore at this age, without having it pushed on them in the generic form of a sheet of equations. This also helps for them to create their own systems of remembering how things such as halving works, which builds their own cognitive thinking skills. 

Using the dough, the children can also explore the idea of conservation of mass and volume. This can be done by taking a certain amount of dough and starting off by making a shape, such as a sphere. This sphere has a very specific mass and volume. Then, without adding or removing any dough, make a new shape. This new shape will have the exact same mass and volume as the original sphere. This links quite closely with the idea of adding two object's individual masses will be equal to the mass if the two objects were combines, which is incredibly useful in both mathematics and physics, when it comes to models of moving objects.
