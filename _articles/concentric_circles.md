Concentric circles are all around us, in things we make, like tin cans and in nature, inside trees. They are a type of parallel curve, [you can learn more about parallel curves in our article about them]({{site.baseurl}}/articles/parallel_lines/#parallel-curves). 

For circles to be concentric, they must have a constant distance between them, which is the same as them having the same [centre]({{site.baseurl}}/articles/circles_/# centre). In the image below, we can see some concentric circles on a grid.

**What is special about concentric circles? What do they share?**
<br>***“Share the same centre”***

In one nursery setting, the children became very interested in drawing spirals and concentric circles. One day, the nursery practitioners laid out a collection of objects (shown below) which linked to concentric circles to see what the children would think. The children were excited and some of their comments are given below.

**What makes what you see the same?**
<br>***“Circles”***
<br>***“Concentric circles”***
<br>***“Look at that big circle”***
<br>***“A big circle there”***

**Are they all the same?**
<br>***“No they are different. They big, and that one little.”***
<br>***“Different sizes”***
<br>***“That one like a concentric circle because they little and big circles”***

The children then began to draw concentric circles next to the objects they had seen. Some of their drawing is shown in the image below.

Identifying and drawing concentric circles is a great activity for children, and some of the other instances of children creating or finding concentric circles are shown in the images below. They particularly enjoyed finding the concentric circles in natural objects like slices of beetroot and sections of trees. Some of these cases are shown in the image below.  

{% include figure image_path="/assets/img/concentric_circles_collage.jpeg" alt="Four photos showing concentric circles in objects. The first is some slices of beetroot where we can see concentric circles in each slice. The second is a tree slice where a child has drawn concentric circles and spirals next to a tree slice. The third is a tree slice that has had ink applied to it so that the concentric circles stand out. The fourth is some concentric circles made out of string." title="temp" %}
