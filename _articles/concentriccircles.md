# Concentric circles

A group of the children were sat together, drawing spirals and concentric circles, after discussing the idea of concentric circles and how they were "circles that share a common centre". This allowed the children to really push their cognitive skills on their own as they were able to discuss each other's drawings together, leading to others joining in and forming a much larger and deeper discussion than what will potentially have been made if they were pushed into having this conversation. They took the time to draw various versions of both spirals and concentric circles and discussed how to identify which was which. The children themselves discovered that the concentric circles were the ones that were circles inside of other, bigger circles, but they all remain as separate circles, compared to a spiral, which appears to many circles that overlap. Therefore, it is clear that this activity allowed the children to push their critical mathematical thinking skills as they were able to demonstrate their own understanding of previous learning material and also create their own definition, in which they were able to understand and use to analyse a larger group of circular shapes.

Their creative mathematical skills were stretched when they were invited to a cloth laid out on the floor with lots of different objects on it, such as string, bottle lids and gems. They were given the time to observe the items and then asked one question, "What makes these items all the same?". The first response was "They are all circles." but then, after some more discussions, they came to the conclusion that it was due to them all being concentric circles in the way the objects were laid out.

There are many ways in which concentric circles can be demonstrated, using objects that are often within a home, such as slicing beetroot so you are able to see the individual xylem and phloem "ring" shapes. It is also possible to use many circular lids, of differing size, and place them within one another, potentially in various ways, in order to avoid solely focusing on one particular visual representation. It is also possible to demonstrate concentric circles with natural wood slices, as these show the circles from within the trunk of the tree, however, these circles will not be perfect circles and will be irregular, so it may be slightly more difficult to see the separation between the lines. It is important to allow the children the time to analyse the objects and re-word the definitions themselves, as it will allow them to understand the idea a lot clearer and also will allow them to use it within the correct context/situation.
