Some of the children were experimenting with different ways of measuring the lengths of objects, using different units. Naturally, many children and adults will automatically jump to grab a ruler when being told to measure something, however that is not the only unit that is available. 

For example, it is possible to use something like a pen, or remote control to measure how long a pillow is or how wide a couch is. They could also measure the same object, using different units of measurement and comparing the results. For example, the length of couch in cushions, compared to the length of the same couch in books or in crisp packets. This allows the children to deepen their creative mathematical thinking skills and hence, develop their cognitive skills as they will begin to understand the importance of knowing what unit was used to measure an item. This is particularly helpful when it comes to maths later in life and life as a whole because there are so many units of measurement to use for one task. Not only this, but we may also allow them to develop analytical skills, by asking the after comparing the measurements of the same object, which unit was more efficient. 

For example, in cushions, a couch's length is 3, but when it comes to the couch's length in books, it is 9. Therefore, it may be more useful to use the length in books as, when comparing it to, for example, a  small chair, a unit of cushions may be too big. However, if we were comparing a cushion's length to the length of the couch, then the unit of cushions would work as, one cushion is 1 unit long and the couch is 3 units. Therefore, the couch is 3 times the size as the cushion.  

The image below gives a visual example of above:

In order to gain a full understanding of the importance of units, it may be helpful to have this repeated with many different objects. 

It may also be useful to try using the larger unit, in this case the cushion, as a way of measuring a larger object in the unit of books, by creating a  compound unit. This would be done by stating that "One cushion unit is 3 book units", then, if something was 11 cushions long, then it would be 33 books long. This is incredibly useful when it comes to measuring larger objects as it is more time efficient and also a lot easier to do in terms of equipment. 

The children may also wish to make their own "rulers" using a bit of paper or cardboard, which is also another way of measuring something, without using a regular ruler, so this is still going to push their cognitive and creative thinking skills. Some examples of this are below:
