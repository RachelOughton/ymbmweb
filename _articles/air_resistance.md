In our article on [gravity]({{site.baseurl}}/articles/gravity/), we discussed how all objects have the same acceleration due to gravity. Some objects fall slower than others when dropped, due to **air resistance**. 

Air resistance is the force of air pushing up on an object as it falls, which slows an object's fall. The larger the surface area of an object, the more air resistance it will experience. 

A popular example is a feather and a bowling ball; you can see videos of this experiment online, explained by Brian Cox. If a feather and a bowling ball are dropped at the same time, we would expect the bowling ball to speed towards the ground and the feather to float down slowly. If a feather and a bowling ball are dropped at the same time in a vacuum chamber (where there is no air), they will both hit the floor at the same time.

The reason that the feather and the bowling ball hit the ground at the same time is that there is no air in the chamber. This means that the bowling ball and the feather cannot experience air resistance. When there is air in the chamber, both the feather and the bowling ball experience air resistance. As the feather has a large surface area and is light, the effect of air resistance slows the fall of the feather more than it slows the fall of the bowling ball. Another version of this experiment was performed on the moon during the Apollo missions and can also be viewed online.

Children can perform their own experiments in the classroom to explore air resistance.

Children can perform their own version of the feather experiment using a feather and a marble. Dropping both at the same time, the children should observe that the feather hits the ground after the marble as it floats through the air. Children could try an experiment with two sheets of paper; they could scrunch one up into a ball and leave the other one as a flat sheet. The flat sheet should fall more slowly than the ball as it experiences more air resistance due to its larger surface area.

## Terminal velocity
When an object falls for long enough through the air, it stops speeding up. When this happens, we say that the object has reached its **terminal velocity**. An object reaches terminal velocity when the force of air resistance on the object is the same size as the force of gravity on the object, meaning the object can no longer speed up.
