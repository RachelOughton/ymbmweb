One popular classroom activity is colouring, and an interesting mathematical property is the **four colour theorem**. If we want to colour in a drawing or map so that no sections that are next to each other (share an edge), we can do so using only four colours. In the images below you can see that the drawing has been coloured in using four colours, and no adjacent sections are the same colour. We are not worried about sections that meet at a point here. You can try the colouring yourself by printing a copy of the blank image or you could try with a picture of your own.

Colouring problems like this are fun for children to attempt, and they can also start discussions about the best strategies. For instance, it is logical to start with one of the triangles in the image and then work your way around the image by colouring the next adjacent sections. If we started by colouring triangles in different corners of the drawing, we might not be able to find a way to colour in the drawing correctly with only four colours. Children could develop their own strategies for tackling the problem and talk about why they are effective.
