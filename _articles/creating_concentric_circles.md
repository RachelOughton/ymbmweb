Inspired by a discussion about concentric circles, some nursery practitioners encouraged the children at a nursery to create some concentric circles. Throughout the process they talked about the features of concentric circles together. 

Teacher: **What do we have on the floor?**
<br>***“Circle”***
<br>***“One”***
<br>Teacher: **Does a circle have a centre point?**
<br>***“There”*** A child takes a rock and places it at the centre of the circle
<br>Teacher: **Is it a concentric circle?** 
<br>This got a mixture of answers, some yes and some no. The children who said no, said the circle wasn’t a concentric circle ***“because only one circle”***. 
<br> Teacher: **What could we do to make it a concentric circle?**
<br>***“Put more there”***

The children then worked to add more circles inside the first one to create a set of concentric circles.
