Some of the children were experimenting with warm water and ice cubes. The time it took for the ice to melt depended on the ways they tried to melt the ice with the water. 

The image below shows the outside area of an ice cube (the surface area), which is the area of each square face. This allows us to see the ice as the cube shape, rather than just ice. Although ice is not always cube shaped, it will still have the same surface area concept.

How much ice surface area is being covered by the warm water will determine the speed in which the ice melts. For example, an ice cube in a tub of warm water will have its surface area completely surrounded in warm water, whereas just pouring some warm water onto the ice means it will melt slowly. This is due to only a small amount of the ice's surface area being in contact with the warm water. Both examples are demonstrated in the images below:

The children were very quick to realise that pouring the water was resulting in a lot slower melting process and that covering the ice with the warm water would be a lot faster, which is a clear demonstration of them understanding that the more surface area covered, the more of the ice being warmed and so a quicker melting process.
