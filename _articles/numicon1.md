# Numicons

Numicons is a new approach to teaching maths to early years that can help children see the connection between numbers. These are flat plastic tiles that represent numbers from 1 to 10.

One of the children took a keen interest in this activity, which began with them copying a pattern. During this activity, this child was interested in a pattern which the teacher was making.

Following this, the child and teacher worked as a team to create a numicon pattern together. Whilst this child's indpendent maths skills were clearly demonstrated previous to them wanting to join in with their teacher, it can also be highlighted that their interest in working as a team is also a great skill to be building at their age.

This child sometimes did struggle with the orientation of the shapes. The topic of horizontal and vertical shapes and tiles were discussed and they were able to model this back to their teacher using the tiles. The teacher also supported this child when finding empty spaces to place their tiles.

This child was able to complete the pattern and was able to solve tricky probelms with minimal support.

As they were making the pattern, this child was able to make links on their own between how a tile with four holes would take up the same amount of space as two tiles with two holes. This then led to the teacher and this child discussing how 3+3=6 and that this activity, numicon, is a great way of combining numbers and seeing what they are equal to. This led to the image above where this child was able to understand that a tile with 6 holes is equal to two tiles with 3 holes.

This resource can be used in mutiple different ways. For exmaple, 6 is 3+3 but it is also 2+2+2 and this can also be seen as 2x3 or 3x2. Numicons can be useful to older children when it comes to multiplcations, and for proving that these statements are true rather than multiplication and addition facts that need to be accepted. The different ways in which you can add numbers together to make 10 led to the discussion of the famous mathemetician Gauss. As a punishment in school, Gauss was made to add up the first 100 integers (e.g 1+2+3+4+5+6...+99+100). He did this very quickly by realising that 1+100=101, 2+99=101, ... , 50+51=101. 

Similarly, the numicon pairing all together make 5x10=50 and this can also be split into 1+2+3+4+5+5+6+7+8+9. So, if you were to take out the extra 5, then this sum would equal 45.

You can also talk about how many different ways you can make a given number by adding up smaller numbers. For example, 5 can be added up by doing 4+1, 3+2, 3+1+1, 2+2+1, 2+1+1+1 or 1+1+1+1+1. These are known as partitions, for example 5 would have seven partions (since 5 itself counts as a partition). This simpler mathematical thinking can become harder as the numbers get larger. For example, there are 101 partions of 13 and 10,143 partions of 33.
