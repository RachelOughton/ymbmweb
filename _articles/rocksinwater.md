Many of the children enjoyed dropping rocks into the river water and watching the splashes. After a few goes of dropping the rocks, we are able to identify a pattern between both the rock and splash sizes, and the height at which the rock has been dropped and the size of the splash in the water it makes.

After experimenting with a few different rock sizes, it is clear that the larger rocks made a much larger splash and those that were a lot smaller in size were making smaller water splashes. This is because, the larger the rock, the larger the mass and so larger the force (weight) in which it hits the water with, pushing more water out around it. If the rock has a small weight then there will be less force pushing the water out and so a smaller splash. 

There is also a correlation between the height at which the rock is dropped and the size of the splash it makes. If the rock is dropped from a large height, there is more time for it to gain speed (momentum) and so again, will hit the water with greater force, resulting in a larger splash. However, if the rock is dropped from a smaller height, then there will be less time for it to gain nay momentum and so, there would only be a small splash made. The children were able to recognise that there was a correlation between the height dropped and the splash size, and the size of the rock and the splash size when dropping the rocks multiple times.
