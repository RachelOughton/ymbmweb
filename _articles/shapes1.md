# Equivalent shapes

Play dough is another activity that can engage children with mathematics, mainly when it comes to making and creating shapes.

One of the children enjoyed making the play dough itself by measuring out and mixing the ingredients. This activity links with the basics of ratios, which also is similar to another child who enjoyed making cakes by mixing ingredients together. In both cases, the children are developing their independence by doing these activities.

Using a cutter, they cut the play dough into a circle and were able to identify the name of the shape they had cut. They were then encouraged by their teacher to try and make circles which were equal in size, although one came out larger than the other. The teacher asked them whether these circles were equivalent and they did understand that their play dough circles were not equivalent, which shows that they can identify what equal shapes look like. We can also interpet from this interaction that this child has an understanding of what the word "equal" means. After discussing the idea of equivalence further with their teacher, this child did try to create two equal sized pieces with some success. Afterwards, they communicated that they had created a large circle and a small circle, which further shows their differntiation between different sized shapes and equality.

In mathematics, equal is the same as saying "congruent", "equivalent" or "isomorphic". When it comes to equality we ask ourselves which sides/lengths can be the same and what can be different. For example, two lines can be equal when they are the same length, even if they point in different directions. In terms of what is parallel, two lines may not be the exact same length but they would have to be pointing in the same direction. Two triangles are similar if they have the same shape (thus the same angles) but are different in size and/or are standing a different way up. However, those triangles are simply similar and are not equal because their lengths are not the same even if their angles are.

For this child's play dough, we can also bring in the factor of volume for questioning whether two shapes/objects are equal. For this child and teacher, to check if these two play dough circles are equal they could check on balance scales and pinch bits off of the heavier one to make them equal. On a more surface-level analysis, this child most likely finds it easier to view both circles and decide off of their own judgment whether they are equal.

Following these ideas, what this is dicussing can link with that of fairness in experiments, when it comes to equality that is. With experiments of this kind, you'd have to keep other variables controlled so you could look at one aspect of equivalence, whether that be size, shape, volume or something else. If it came to something like this, it would be much harder in an experiment for children to try and distinguish between shapes that were different and decided which ones were larger etc.

In relation to this, there is a famous experiment in which young children are shown a short line of blocks that are close together in distance. The blocks are then spread out further away from one another and are then asked whether there are more blocks than before. Some of the children responded with "yes" and perhaps this is because they may have misinterpreted the question as asking "is the line longer?". However, one could also wonder if they would get a higher number if they counted the blocks themselves. The concept that, as long as you don't add or take away any blocks, there will obviously be the same number of them is known as "conservation". Another way of thinking about conservation is if you relate this then back to the child's play dough and how as long as he has the same amount of play dough he could create many different shapes and it would still be viewed as conservation.

In the observation of this child specifically, it's interesting and exciting to hear them using mathematical terminology to converse their ideas about what they are doing and what is happening. The teacher at this nursery tries challenging their thinking by introducing new words to them, such as "size" and "equal", as well as asking about what the children mean when they speak, perhaps, more plainly about what they are doing. It is not to be mistakent that when teachers do this they are expecting this child to understand what the world means immediately but instead allow the child to "try out" the word in different contexts and discuss how it might be interpeted or clarified. We can also view this in how we learn and understand mathematical concepts at any level of learning and education.
