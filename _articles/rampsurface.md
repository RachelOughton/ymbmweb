Some of the children wanted to make ramps that had different surfaces, which changed how the object went down the ramps. 

They understood that the surfaces that were a lot rougher made the objects go a lot slower than those that were smooth, which is a great example of understanding friction. The images below gives a few examples of what we can use to demonstrate this:

A rougher surface will have a much larger friction on an object than one that is smooth and so, will either slow the object down on the ramp, or make it stop completely due to there being more force "holding the object back", rather than weight (force) of the object pulling it down the ramp. 

This friction also depends on the object itself as, an object with wheels, such as a toy car, will generally go down a ramp quicker than something that doesn't have wheels (such as the shell in the above pictures). This is due to the fact that the wheels will have a reduced friction and have a greater force pushing it down the ramp, making it easier to move the weight at a quicker speed on a rough surface however, friction still acts on the car. 

The condition of the ramp may also effect the speed of the object going down the ramp, such as a smooth surface ramp that may have had water poured onto it, may allow objects to move a lot quicker down the ramp as the water acts as a coating between the ramps surface and the object. This then reduces or removes the friction and so the only force acting on the object is the weight of the object. 

The idea of forces and friction also works when going up a ramp rather than down. An object on a smoother ramp may require a lot more force to push it up the ramp due to the lack of friction. This is because the weight of the object will be pulling it down the ramp and there will be no or less friction to stop it from going back down the ramp. The children would then likely indicate that for the object to go up the ramp they would need to move it themselves (demonstrated both physically and verbally).
